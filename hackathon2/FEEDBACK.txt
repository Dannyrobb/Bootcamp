Meir I really like how the website is built, the colors ,style and content!
Please let me know if I am missing something but I do not see any JAVASCRIPT on the project.
Purely HTML and CSS?
If this is the case the project definetly needs JS,database connection,fetch api..
As I said at the beggining still looks really good style wise.
Good luck and good job!
